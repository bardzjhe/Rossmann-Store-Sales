# Rossmann-Store-Sales
Game Theory course project AMA1D04.

Details in GameTheory_Project.pdf

To the best of my knowledge, it would be the first project that correlates game theory with Rossmann Store Sales, the meaningful real-world data.
Moreover, some interesting/critical finding and suggestions for store location and operation have been proposed in this project.
